//What this code needs to do is to:
//1.  Take a list of numbers in which are already barcoded that are in the system.  
//2.  Locate the numbers that are missing out of that list.  These will be the books that are not in the system yet.
//3.  Take another list of numbers in, which is the physical inventory of books with barcodes on the shelves.
//4.  Compare one set of numbers to another set of numbers.
//5.  Highlight the barcode numbers which are in the inventory but not in the system yet, and identify them in order
//of the inventory in order to make locating them easier.  

//From this website http://jsclass.jcoglan.com/set.html, this could be useful:
//difference(other)

//Returns a new set containing all the members of the receiver that are not in the set other.

//var a = new Set([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]);
//var b = new Set([2,4,6,8]);

//a.difference(b)
// -> Set{1,3,5,7,9}
//IndexOf()?
